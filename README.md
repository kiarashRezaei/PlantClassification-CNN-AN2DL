## Description

This project is part of Homework 1 of Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning(AN2DL) course (A.Y 22/23) and focuses on image classification using transfer learning with various pre-trained models such as ResNet50, ResNet152, and EfficientNetB4. The goal is to classify images into one of the eight categories.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiarashRezaei/PlantClassification-CNN.git
```

### Prerequisites

To run the code, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python pillow
```

### Installation

After installing the dependencies, download the training dataset zip file ('training_dataset_homework1.zip') and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Open the 'Homework_1_Image_Classification.ipynb' notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the following tasks:
   - Extract the training dataset from the zip file.
   - Preprocess the images and split them into training and validation sets.
   - Create and train transfer learning models using ResNet50 and ResNet152 architectures.
   - Evaluate the model performance and visualize the training/validation loss and accuracy.

## Model Training

The code uses transfer learning with pre-trained models (ResNet50, ResNet152, EfficientNetB4) for image classification. The models are fine-tuned with custom dense layers to adapt to the specific classification task.

## Results

The project evaluates the model's performance on the validation set, providing metrics such as loss and accuracy. Additionally, it visualizes the training and validation loss/accuracy over epochs to monitor model training.
